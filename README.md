# MAD6135 Project
Create a Web application based on JavaScript, CSS and HTML that implements an online task management system.

1. There are two types of users in this application: members and administrators.
2. Administrators can create a task and assign a member to that task using members email addresses. The admin user that creates the task is considered then owner of that task and has all the rights/permissions to create the following:
Tasks (task id, task name, task description, task start date, task end date)
3. Assign members to created tasks (every member can be paid a different hourly rate, so please assign this as well).
4. Assigned members can check when the task is complete. In this case, application records the date and time of completion. Members should also enter the hours they worked in this task.
5. When the member completes the task, application should mark the task as complete and record total number of hours members worked on it and the cost of completing the project.
6. For data storage use local storage or any other storage you are comfortable with.
7. Every administrator should be able to see all the tasks they have created along with their details (status)/
